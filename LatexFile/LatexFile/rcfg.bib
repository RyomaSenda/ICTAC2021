abstract="In this paper we introduce context-free grammars and pushdown automata over infinite alphabets. It is shown that a language is generated by a context-free grammar over an infinite alphabet if and only if it is accepted by a pushdown automaton over an infinite alphabet. Also the generated (accepted) languages possess many of the properties of the ordinary context-free languages: decidability, closure properties, etc.. This provides a substantial evidence for considering context-free grammars and pushdown automata over infinite alphabets as a natural extension of the classical ones. ",

With a restricted memory structure that consists of a finite number of registers, a finite-memory automaton can store arbitrary input symbols. Thus, the language accepted by a finite-memory automaton is defined over a potentially infinite alphabet. The following decision problems are studied for a general finite-memory automata A as well as for deterministic ones: the membership problem, i.e., given an A and a string w, to decide whether w is accepted by A, and the non-emptiness problem, i.e., given an A, to decide whether the language accepted by A is non-empty. The membership problem is P-complete, provided a given automaton is deterministic, and each of the other problems is NP-complete. Thus, we conclude that the decision problems considered are intractable."
