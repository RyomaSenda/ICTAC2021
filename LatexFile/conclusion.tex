\section{Conclusion}
We have discussed the realizability problem
whose specification and implementation are
DPDA (NPDA) and PDT in Section 4.
To use the result in \cite{Wa96},
we show \Real$($\DPDA,\PDT$)$ is decidable.
We also show the undecidability of \Real$($\NPDA,\PDT$)$
by the reduction from the universality problem of NPDA.
In Section 5, we have defined RPDT, RPDA and
show the way to simulate the label of the language of RPDA by PDA.
We have introduced the notions of stack-visibly \cite{AM04} and
test-visibly to discuss the decidability of realizability
for RPDA and RPDT.
We show that the behavior of registers and stack of RPDT
can be simulated by the finite alphabels defined as finite actions,
and prove that \Real$($\DRPDAv,\RPDTk$)$ can be reduced to \Real$($\DPDA,\PDT$)$.

It is still unknown whether the realizability problem is decidable
when the specification is given by an universal PDA,
DRPDA has no restriction of visibility and
the number of registers of RPDT is not given.
Investigating these cases are future work.
