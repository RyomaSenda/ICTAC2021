\section{Conclusion}
We have discussed the realizability problem
whose specification and implementation are
DPDA (NPDA) and PDT in Section 4.
By using the result in \cite{Wa96},
we show \Real$($\DPDA,\PDT$)$ is in EXPTIME.
We also show the undecidability of \Real$($\NPDA,\PDT$)$
by a reduction from the universality problem of NPDA.
In Section 5, we have defined RPDT, RPDA and
showm a way to recognize the label of the language of RPDA by PDA.
We have introduced the notions of stack-visibly \cite{AM04} and
test-visibly to discuss the decidability of realizability
for RPDA and RPDT.
We show that the behavior of registers and stack of RPDT
can be simulated by the finite alphabels defined as finite actions,
and prove that \Real$($\DRPDAv,\RPDTk$)$ can be reduced to \Real$($\DPDA,\PDT$)$ and is in 2EXPTIME.

It is still unknown whether the realizability problem is decidable
in several cases such as
the specification is given by a universal PDA,
DRPDA has no restriction on visibility and
the number of registers of RPDT is not given.
Investigating these cases are future work.
